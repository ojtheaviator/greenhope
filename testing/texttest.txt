Messina.         ACT I    SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.     Enter Leonato, Hero, Beatrice and others, with a Messenger.    LEONATO. I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.    MESSENGER. He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.    LEONATO. How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?    MESSENGER. But few of any sort, and none of name.    LEONATO. A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.    MESSENGER. Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.    LEONATO. He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.    MESSENGER. I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.    LEONATO. Did he break out into tears?    MESSENGER. In great measure.    LEONATO. A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!    BEATRICE. I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?    MESSENGER. I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army of any sort.    LEONATO. What is he that you ask for, niece?    HERO. My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.    MESSENGER. O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.    BEATRICE. He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight; and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing.    LEONATO. Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.    MESSENGER. He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.    BEATRICE. You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it; he is a very valiant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.    MESSENGER. And a good soldier too, lady.    BEATRICE. And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?    MESSENGER. A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable virtues.    BEATRICE. It is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the stuffing,—well, we are all mortal.    LEONATO. You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.    BEATRICE. Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.    MESSENGER. Is’t possible?    BEATRICE. Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.    MESSENGER. I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.    BEATRICE. No; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?    MESSENGER. He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.    BEATRICE. O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.    MESSENGER. I will hold friends with you, lady.    BEATRICE. Do, good friend.    LEONATO. You will never run mad, niece.    BEATRICE. No, not till a hot January.    MESSENGER. Don Pedro is approached.    Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar and Others.    DON PEDRO. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.    LEONATO. Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.    DON PEDRO. You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.    LEONATO. Her mother hath many times told me so.    BENEDICK. Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?    LEONATO. Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.    DON PEDRO. You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honourable father.    BENEDICK. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.    BEATRICE. I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody marks you.    BENEDICK. What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?    BEATRICE. Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.    BENEDICK. Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.    BEATRICE. A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.    BENEDICK. God keep your Ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.    BEATRICE. Scratching could not make it worse, and ’twere such a face as yours were.    BENEDICK. Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.    BEATRICE. A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.    BENEDICK. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i’ God’s name; I have done.    BEATRICE. You always end with a jade’s trick: I know you of old.    DON PEDRO. That is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.    LEONATO. If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [To Don John] Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.    DON JOHN. I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you.    LEONATO. Please it your Grace lead on?    DON PEDRO. Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.    [Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio.]    CLAUDIO. Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?    BENEDICK. I noted her not; but I looked on her.    CLAUDIO. Is she not a modest young lady?    BENEDICK. Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?    CLAUDIO. No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.    BENEDICK. Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.    CLAUDIO. Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.    BENEDICK. Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?    CLAUDIO. Can the world buy such a jewel?    BENEDICK. Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song?    CLAUDIO. In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.    BENEDICK. I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there’s her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?    CLAUDIO. I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.    BENEDICK. Is’t come to this, in faith? Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith; and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.    Re-enter Don Pedro.    Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.    DON PEDRO. What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonato’s?    BENEDICK. I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.    DON PEDRO. I charge thee on thy allegiance.    BENEDICK. You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance mark you this, on my allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.    CLAUDIO. If this were so, so were it uttered.    BENEDICK. Like the old tale, my lord: ‘it is not so, nor ’twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so.’    CLAUDIO. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.    DON PEDRO. Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.    CLAUDIO. You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.    DON PEDRO. By my troth, I speak my thought.    CLAUDIO. And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.    BENEDICK. And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.    CLAUDIO. That I love her, I feel.    DON PEDRO. That she is worthy, I know.    BENEDICK. That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.    DON PEDRO. Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.    CLAUDIO. And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.    BENEDICK. That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,—for the which I may go the finer,—I will live a bachelor.    DON PEDRO. I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.    BENEDICK. With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.    DON PEDRO. Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.    BENEDICK. If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.    DON PEDRO. Well, as time shall try: ‘In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.’    BENEDICK. The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead; and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, ‘Here is good horse to hire,’ let them signify under my sign ‘Here you may see Benedick the married man.’    CLAUDIO. If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.    DON PEDRO. Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.    BENEDICK. I look for an earthquake too then.    DON PEDRO. Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s: commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great preparation.    BENEDICK. I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit you—    CLAUDIO. To the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,—    DON PEDRO. The sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick.    BENEDICK. Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I leave you.    [Exit.]    CLAUDIO. My liege, your Highness now may do me good.    DON PEDRO. My love is thine to teach: teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good.    CLAUDIO. Hath Leonato any son, my lord?    DON PEDRO. No child but Hero; she’s his only heir. Dost thou affect her, Claudio?    CLAUDIO. O! my lord, When you went onward on this ended action, I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye, That lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love; But now I am return’d, and that war-thoughts Have left their places vacant, in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires, All prompting me how fair young Hero is, Saying, I lik’d her ere I went to wars.    DON PEDRO. Thou wilt be like a lover presently, And tire the hearer with a book of words. If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her, and with her father, And thou shalt have her. Was’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?    CLAUDIO. How sweetly you do minister to love, That know love’s grief by his complexion! But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salv’d it with a longer treatise.    DON PEDRO. What need the bridge much broader than the flood? The fairest grant is the necessity. Look, what will serve is fit: ’tis once, thou lov’st, And I will fit thee with the remedy. I know we shall have revelling tonight: I will assume thy part in some disguise, And tell fair Hero I am Claudio; And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart, And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale: Then after to her father will I break; And the conclusion is, she shall be thine. In practice let us put it presently.    [Exeunt.]    SCENE II. A room in Leonato’s house.    Enter Leonato and Antonio, meeting.    LEONATO. How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he provided this music?    ANTONIO. He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.    LEONATO. Are they good?    ANTONIO. As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.    LEONATO.  Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?    ANTONIO. A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself.    LEONATO. No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.    [Several persons cross the stage.]    Cousins, you know what you have to do. O! I cry you mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.    [Exeunt.]    SCENE III. Another room in Leonato’s house.    Enter Don John and Conrade.    CONRADE. What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad?    DON JOHN. There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the sadness is without limit.    CONRADE. You should hear reason.    DON JOHN. And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?    CONRADE. If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.    DON JOHN. I wonder that thou (being as thou say’st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour.    CONRADE. Yea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace; where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.    DON JOHN. I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.    CONRADE.  Can you make no use of your discontent?    DON JOHN.  I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?    Enter Borachio.    What news, Borachio?    BORACHIO. I came yonder from a great supper: the Prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.    DON JOHN. Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?    BORACHIO. Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.    DON JOHN. Who? the most exquisite Claudio?    BORACHIO. Even he.    DON JOHN. A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he?    BORACHIO. Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.    DON JOHN. A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?    BORACHIO. Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.    DON JOHN. Come, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?    CONRADE.  To the death, my lord.    DON JOHN. Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of my mind! Shall we go to prove what’s to be done?    BORACHIO. We’ll wait upon your Lordship.    [Exeunt.]         ACT II    SCENE I. A hall in Leonato’s house.     Enter Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice and others.    LEONATO. Was not Count John here at supper?    ANTONIO. I saw him not.    BEATRICE. How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after.    HERO. He is of a very melancholy disposition.    BEATRICE. He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing; and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.    LEONATO. Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s face—    BEATRICE. With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world if a’ could get her good will.    LEONATO. By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.    ANTONIO. In faith, she’s too curst.    BEATRICE. Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God’s sending that way; for it is said, ‘God sends a curst cow short horns;’ but to a cow too curst he sends none.    LEONATO. So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?    BEATRICE. Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.    LEONATO. You may light on a husband that hath no beard.    BEATRICE. What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.    LEONATO. Well then, go you into hell?    BEATRICE. No; but to the gate; and there will the Devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, ‘Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.’ So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens: he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.    ANTONIO. [To Hero.] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.    BEATRICE. Yes, faith; it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please you:’— but yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please me.’    LEONATO. Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.    BEATRICE. Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none: Adam’s sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.    LEONATO. Daughter, remember what I told you: if the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.    BEATRICE. The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time: if the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and with his bad legs, falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.    LEONATO. Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.    BEATRICE. I have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight.    LEONATO. The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.    Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, Don John, Borachio, Margaret, Ursula and Others, masked.    DON PEDRO. Lady, will you walk about with your friend?    HERO. So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.    DON PEDRO. With me in your company?    HERO. I may say so, when I please.    DON PEDRO. And when please you to say so?    HERO. When I like your favour; for God defend the lute should be like the case!    DON PEDRO. My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house is Jove.    HERO. Why, then, your visor should be thatch’d.    DON PEDRO. Speak low, if you speak love.    [Takes her aside.]    BALTHASAR. Well, I would you did like me.    MARGARET. So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many ill qualities.    BALTHASAR. Which is one?    MARGARET. I say my prayers aloud.    BALTHASAR. I love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen.    MARGARET. God match me with a good dancer!    BALTHASAR. Amen.    MARGARET. And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer, clerk.    BALTHASAR. No more words: the clerk is answered.    URSULA. I know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio.    ANTONIO. At a word, I am not.    URSULA. I know you by the waggling of your head.    ANTONIO. To tell you true, I counterfeit him.    URSULA. You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man. Here’s his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.    ANTONIO. At a word, I am not.    URSULA. Come, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there’s an end.    BEATRICE. Will you not tell me who told you so?    BENEDICK. No, you shall pardon me.    BEATRICE. Nor will you not tell me who you are?    BENEDICK. Not now.    BEATRICE. That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the ‘Hundred Merry Tales.’ Well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.    BENEDICK. What’s he?    BEATRICE. I am sure you know him well enough.    BENEDICK. Not I, believe me.    BEATRICE. Did he never make you laugh?    BENEDICK. I pray you, what is he?    BEATRICE. Why, he is the Prince’s jester: a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villainy; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me!    BENEDICK. When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.    BEATRICE. Do, do: he’ll but break a comparison or two on me; which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy; and then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night. [Music within.] We must follow the leaders.    BENEDICK. In every good thing.    BEATRICE. Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.    [Dance. Then exeunt all but Don John, Borachio and Claudio.]    DON JOHN. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.    BORACHIO. And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.    DON JOHN. Are you not Signior Benedick?    CLAUDIO. You know me well; I am he.    DON JOHN. Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no equal for his birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it.    CLAUDIO. How know you he loves her?    DON JOHN. I heard him swear his affection.    BORACHIO. So did I too; and he swore he would marry her tonight.    DON JOHN. Come, let us to the banquet.    [Exeunt Don John and Borachio.]    CLAUDIO. Thus answer I in name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. ’Tis certain so; the Prince wooss for himself. Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love: Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues; Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood. This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!    Re-enter Benedick.    BENEDICK. Count Claudio?    CLAUDIO. Yea, the same.    BENEDICK. Come, will you go with me?    CLAUDIO. Whither?    BENEDICK. Even to the next willow, about your own business, Count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer’s chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant’s scarf? You must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.    CLAUDIO. I wish him joy of her.    BENEDICK. Why, that’s spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?    CLAUDIO. I pray you, leave me.    BENEDICK. Ho! now you strike like the blind man: ’twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.    CLAUDIO. If it will not be, I’ll leave you.    [Exit.]    BENEDICK. Alas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.    Re-enter Don Pedro.    DON PEDRO. Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see him?    BENEDICK. Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.    DON PEDRO. To be whipped! What’s his fault?    BENEDICK. The flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy’d with finding a bird’s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.    DON PEDRO. Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.    BENEDICK. Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird’s nest.    DON PEDRO. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner.    BENEDICK. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.    DON PEDRO. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.    BENEDICK. O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her: my very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.    Re-enter Claudio, Beatrice, Hero and Leonato.    DON PEDRO. Look! here she comes.    BENEDICK. Will your Grace command me any service to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John’s foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Cham’s beard; do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words’ conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?    DON PEDRO. None, but to desire your good company.    BENEDICK. O God, sir, here’s a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.    [Exit.]    DON PEDRO. Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.    BEATRICE. Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.    DON PEDRO. You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.    BEATRICE. So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.    DON PEDRO. Why, how now, Count! wherefore are you sad?    CLAUDIO. Not sad, my lord.    DON PEDRO. How then? Sick?    CLAUDIO. Neither, my lord.    BEATRICE. The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but civil Count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.    DON PEDRO. I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his good will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!    LEONATO. Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it!    BEATRICE. Speak, Count, ’tis your cue.    CLAUDIO. Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.    BEATRICE. Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.    DON PEDRO. In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.    BEATRICE. Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.    CLAUDIO. And so she doth, cousin.    BEATRICE. Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!    DON PEDRO. Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.    BEATRICE. I would rather have one of your father’s getting. Hath your Grace ne’er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.    DON PEDRO. Will you have me, lady?    BEATRICE. No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days: your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your Grace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.    DON PEDRO. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for out of question, you were born in a merry hour.    BEATRICE. No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!    LEONATO. Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?    BEATRICE. I cry you mercy, uncle. By your Grace’s pardon.    [Exit.]    DON PEDRO. By my troth, a pleasant spirited lady.    LEONATO. There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.    DON PEDRO. She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.    LEONATO. O! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.    DON PEDRO. She were an excellent wife for Benedick.    LEONATO. O Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.    DON PEDRO. Count Claudio, when mean you to go to church?    CLAUDIO. Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.    LEONATO. Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night; and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.    DON PEDRO. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules’ labours, which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.    LEONATO. My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights’ watchings.    CLAUDIO. And I, my lord.    DON PEDRO. And you too, gentle Hero?    HERO. I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.    DON PEDRO. And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.    [Exeunt.]    SCENE II. Another room in Leonato’s house.    Enter Don John and Borachio.    DON JOHN. It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.    BORACHIO. Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.    DON JOHN. Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?    BORACHIO. Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.    DON JOHN. Show me briefly how.    BORACHIO. I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.    DON JOHN. I remember.    BORACHIO. I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.    DON JOHN.  What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?    BORACHIO. The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio,—whose estimation do you mightily hold up,—to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.    DON JOHN. What proof shall I make of that?    BORACHIO. Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?    DON JOHN. Only to despite them, I will endeavour anything.    BORACHIO. Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as—in love of your brother’s honour, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,—that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent; and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty, that jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.    DON JOHN. Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.    BORACHIO. Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.    DON JOHN. I will presently go learn their day of marriage.    [Exeunt.]    SCENE III. Leonato’s Garden.    Enter Benedick.    BENEDICK. Boy!    Enter a Boy.    BOY. Signior?    BENEDICK. In my chamber window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the orchard.    BOY. I am here already, sir.    BENEDICK. I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.    [Exit Boy.]    I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe: I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.    [Withdraws.]    Enter Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio, followed by Balthasar and Musicians.    DON PEDRO. Come, shall we hear this music?    CLAUDIO. Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is, As hush’d on purpose to grace harmony!    DON PEDRO. See you where Benedick hath hid himself?    CLAUDIO. O! very well, my lord: the music ended, We’ll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth.    DON PEDRO. Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.    BALTHASAR. O! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once.    DON PEDRO. It is the witness still of excellency, To put a strange face on his own perfection. I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.    BALTHASAR. Because you talk of wooing, I will sing; Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy; yet he wooes; Yet will he swear he loves.    DON PEDRO. Nay, pray thee come; Or if thou wilt hold longer argument, Do it in notes.    BALTHASAR. Note this before my notes; There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.    DON PEDRO. Why these are very crotchets that he speaks; Notes, notes, forsooth, and nothing!    [Music.]    BENEDICK. Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it not strange that sheep’s guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when all’s done.    BALTHASAR [sings.]     Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,      Men were deceivers ever;     One foot in sea, and one on shore,      To one thing constant never.   Then sigh not so, but let them go,  And be you blithe and bonny,    Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.       Sing no more ditties, sing no mo Of dumps so dull and heavy;    The fraud of men was ever so, Since summer first was leavy.  Then sigh not so, but let them go, And be you blithe and bonny,      Converting all your sounds of woe   Into Hey nonny, nonny.
